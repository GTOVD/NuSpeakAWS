                                the speds now. Seriously though, I want to

                                neither. I will do what the most upvoted comment
                                is as long as it‚Äôs a call or a put, no naked
                                calls/puts or shorting (bc I want to stay above
                                a negative net worth.) Thoughts on gme calls?
                                Maybe some big brain popcorn puts? (mOaSs iS
                                tOmorRoW) Thoughts on dwac puts? Or should I
                                play the tried and true spy calls or puts?
